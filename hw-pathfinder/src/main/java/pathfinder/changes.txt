Briefly list any changes you made to your graph class during hw-pathfinder, and why you made those changes.

The main changes I made to my graph class during hw-pathfinder involved changing it to be generic. This involved
changing the original implementation which had Strings for Node and Edge data, and making the Nodes generic as
well as the data for edges.

I did this to be able to use different types of data with my graph class, which greatly helped while I was
implementing Dijkstra's Algorithm and my Model View Controller because I needed to use a Graph that held Points
as Nodes and Doubles for Edge data. With generics, I could do this as well as use Strings, so the tests for this
homework passed, as well as the tests for the past homeworks.
