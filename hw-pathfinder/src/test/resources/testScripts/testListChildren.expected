# Test listing children of node

created graph Graph

added node A to Graph
added node B to Graph
added node C to Graph
added node D to Graph

added edge 1.000 from A to B in Graph
added edge 1.000 from A to C in Graph
added edge 1.000 from A to D in Graph

the children of A in Graph are: B(1.0) C(1.0) D(1.0)
