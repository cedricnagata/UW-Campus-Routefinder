# Test shorter path between multiple nodes

created graph Graph

added node A to Graph
added node B to Graph
added node C to Graph
added node D to Graph

added edge 1.000 from A to B in Graph
added edge 1.000 from B to C in Graph
added edge 1.000 from C to D in Graph
added edge 5.000 from A to D in Graph

path from A to D:
A to B with weight 1.000
B to C with weight 1.000
C to D with weight 1.000
total cost: 3.000
