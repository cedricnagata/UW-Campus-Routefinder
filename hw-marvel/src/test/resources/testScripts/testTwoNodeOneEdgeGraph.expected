# Test MarvelPaths doesn't allow adding reflexive edge

# Parse through the data and build the graph
loaded graph reflexiveGraph

# List nodes and edges to see if the graph is built correctly
reflexiveGraph contains: node1 node2
the children of node1 in reflexiveGraph are: node2(edge1)
the children of node2 in reflexiveGraph are: node1(edge1)

# Find the shortest path node1 to node2
path from node1 to node2:
node1 to node2 via edge1
