Briefly list any changes you made to your graph class during hw-marvel, and why you made those changes.

I added a method to my graph class called getEdgesLabel tht returns a List of String[], that has both
the label of the edge and data of the child Node of the edge stored in it.
I made this change to be able to return a list of edges that only stores Strings to make implementing my
findPath method easier.
I also added two more methods to my graph class called addEdgeLabels and addNodeLabel that each perform the same
action as addEdge and addNode respectively but they both take Strings for arguments instead of Nodes.
I made this change to be able to add Nodes and Edges with only Strings, instead of having to create a Node or edge
first then add it to the graph.
