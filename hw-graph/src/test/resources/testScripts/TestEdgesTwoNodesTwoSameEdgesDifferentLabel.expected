# Create a graph
created graph Graph

# Adds two nodes and two same edges labeled differently connecting them
added node n1 to Graph
added node n2 to Graph
added edge e1_n1n2 from n1 to n2 in Graph
added edge e2_n1n2 from n1 to n2 in Graph

# List the children of n1 in the graph
the children of n1 in Graph are: n2(e1_n1n2) n2(e2_n1n2)
