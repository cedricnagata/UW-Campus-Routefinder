# Create a graph
created graph Graph

# Adds two nodes and two opposite edges connecting them
added node n1 to Graph
added node n2 to Graph
added edge e1_n1n2 from n1 to n2 in Graph
added edge e2_n2n1 from n2 to n1 in Graph

# List the children of n1 in the graph
the children of n1 in Graph are: n2(e1_n1n2)
